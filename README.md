# fanmail
From 2006-2009, I wrote a webcomic entitled [Kirby's Fan Mail](http://fanmail.smackjeeves.com/). The quality of the comic is about what you'd expect from an 11 year old, which is what I was at the time. Nevertheless, someone took the time to write an extremely critical review of the comic, and at one point mentioned that you could swap out the endings of any strip and it'd probably be funnier. Thanks for the advice, friend! You can now check out my Twitter bot, [@MailKirby](https://twitter.com/MailKirby), for Kirby's fantastic and random exploits involving being sent fan mail.
